# IT-Scripts
This is a repository of the scripts I wrote for when I worked at a IT Help Desk at my college. They were created with not being serious in mind. That being said, I want to show the scripts. 
They are fully functional and do what they are supposed to do. I wrote them to add and delete a local account called "loaner" and then to delete the user profiles.
The other script is meant for more in general laptop needs. For example, it will be able to do what the loaner refresh script can do. In addition it can add users to the "Administrators" group. It can add a specified user and or the user that is currently logged in.
The other script can only add and delete the "loaner" account for the use of making loaner computers. I made it so we did not have to run the refresh loaner script. Albeit this is abit excessive but I felt like making a seperate script for this since it was easy enough.
